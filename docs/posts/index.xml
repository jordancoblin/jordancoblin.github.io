      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my very first post of the blog! I wanted to take some time to brush up on ML foundations now that I&amp;rsquo;m in between jobs, and what better place to start than popular computer vision tasks? Knowing myself, I have a habit of not always completing projects that I begin, so my hope is that treating blog posts as completion artifacts for these projects will be a useful forcing function for seeing things through.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
