      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every other month is flu season for my immune system, it appears. I had gone two good, productive years with minimal sickness - which I attribute primarily to being able to sleep without an alarm during grad school. Now, this has to be the fifth or sixth time this year. Absolute circus of an immune system, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go over the symptoms, as an exercise in bodily awareness. In order of most salient, we can begin with the eyes. A general irritation of the eyeballs, with eyelids seemingly carrying the full weight of my unfullfilled dreams. In turn, with sore eyes, the mind yearns for rest - I suppose this is the function of the eye situation, the body’s way of telling you to get the f*ck to sleep and stop moving around so much. I should listen to this signal more obediently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
