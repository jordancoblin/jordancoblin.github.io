Hey there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my experimental blog! My name is Jordan and I am a machine learning engineer with an M.Sc. from the [RLAI Lab](http://rlai.ualberta.ca/) at the University of Alberta. Previously, I've worked on computer vision for agricultural robots at [Upside Robotics](https://upsiderobotics.com/), blockchain collectibles at [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), and conversational analytics at [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/). In my spare time, I enjoy training the art of folding clothes with humans in them, also commonly referred to as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

I am currently open to work and project opportunities. If you'd like to work with me, please reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-coblin-59237597).
