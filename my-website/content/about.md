Hey there ðŸ‘‹ My name is **Jordan**, and I am a machine learning engineer who loves exploring and experimenting with new ideas. This blog is a space to share some of those explorations.

I completed my M.Sc. under [Adam White](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amw8/) in the [RLAI Lab](http://rlai.ualberta.ca/) at the University of Alberta, where my [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vz8l086xKTiqASWE-_ufIc8G-RMQ24sa/view?usp=sharing) was on applying reinforcement learning to a real-world water treatment plant. I've also worked on computer vision for agricultural robots at [Upside Robotics](https://upsiderobotics.com/), blockchain collectibles at [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), and conversational analytics at [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/). In my spare time, I enjoy training in the art of folding clothes while people are still in them, also commonly referred to as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

I am currently open to work and project opportunities. If you'd like to collaborate, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-coblin-59237597).
