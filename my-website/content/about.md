Hey there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my experimental blog! My name is Jordan and I am a machine learning engineer with an M.Sc. from the [RLAI Lab](http://rlai.ualberta.ca/) at the University of Alberta. Previously, I've worked on computer vision for agricultural robots at [Upside Robotics](https://upsiderobotics.com/), blockchain collectibles at [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), and conversational analytics at [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/). In my spare time, I enjoy training the art of folding clothes with people in them, also known colloquially as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
